Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
    Ryan (K) Emerson and Chelsea.

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
    I attended the Sunday TA hours at 1pm.

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    I've programmed in Java before so these aren't my initial impressions, but I enjoy it more than Python. Everything that's happening is clearly laid out, compared to Python at least. Also, all the lines sound like you're casting spells. String string = new string, for example. However, there is a lot of repetition, and it's not a very forgiving language.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
    As is evidence through Java, regardless of how much work is being done behind the language, computers at their core are pretty dumb and require extremely specific instructions in order to do anything at all. Programming therefore requires good understanding of how data is grouped, stored, and moved around. Python is much more forgivig since it handles a lot of data management behind the scenes, but that management must still be doneArrays are very useful tools, and the main bits of every program are pretty much the same. Define your variables, introduce some loops to make stuff more efficient, make your methods, and close everything out at the end.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    I made heavy use of W3 to find the best methods for my application. In comparison to Oracle, I find it easier to read and navigate given that the site itself just seems to be more user friendly. On mine, Oracle doesn't even have a search feature. I would highly reccommend talking with a buddy or two and to take advantage of Slack.
